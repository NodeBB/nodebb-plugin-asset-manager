# Deprecation Notice

This plugin is deprecated now, as NodeBB core already contains the facility to upload and manage files (ACP -> Manage -> Uploads).

# Asset Manager for NodeBB

This plugin introduces a separate route for serving static files to your users. The administration panel is used to add/remove files.

## Installation

Install via the administration panel, or

    npm install nodebb-plugin-asset-manager

## Screenshots
